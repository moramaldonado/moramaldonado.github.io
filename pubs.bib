  abstract = {The Reflexive Belief Construction in Spanish, built by adjoining the reflexive pronoun se to the verb <i> creer (believe) </i>, displays a puzzling interpretive behavior. When unembedded, <i> creerse </i> triggers the inference that its complement clause is false. When embedded under
negation, it triggers the inference that its complement clause is true. We first argue that the
negative inference in the unembedded case is not due to the Maximize Presupposition! principle (Heim, 1991), carving out the empirical profile of <i>creerse</i> along the way. We then explore
two alternative explanations. The first is that <i>creerse</i> presupposes the falsity of its complement.
The second is that <i>creerse</i> presupposes that the attitude holder is wrongly opinionated with
respect to the embedded proposition. We argue that the first analysis fails unless it is supplemented with the syntactic account of neg-raising, whereas the second analysis faces empirical
challenges. We leave the resolution of this dilemma to future work.}

  abstract = {Languages partition semantic space into linguistic categories in systematic ways. In this study, we investigate a semantic space which has received sustained attention in theoretical linguistics: person. Person systems convey the roles entities play in the conversational context (i.e., speaker(s), addressee(s), other(s)). Like other linguistic category systems (e.g. color and kinship terms), not all ways of partitioning the person space are equally likely. We use an artificial language learning paradigm to test whether typological frequency correlates with learnability of person paradigms. We focus on first person systems (e.g., `I' and `we' in English), and test the predictions of a set of theories which posit a universal set of features ({$\pm$}exclusive, and {$\pm$}minimal) to capture this space. Our results provide the first experimental evidence for feature-based theories of person systems.},

  abstract = {Sentences that involve two or more plural expressions, such as numerical expressions, give rise to systematic ambiguities. For example, the sentence Two boys have three balloons can either mean that there are two boys who, between them, have three balloons (cumulative reading) or that there are two boys who each have three balloons (distributive reading). In this paper, we report the results of three experiments which show that the distributive/cumulative ambiguity can give rise to priming effects. That is, when subjects perform a sentence-picture matching task which creates a strong bias towards one of the two types of readings, they are more likely to access the very same type of interpretation when subsequently presented with a different sentence-picture pair which does not create the same bias. This finding suggests that the abstract constructs that linguists posit to account for different types of readings describe some real features of mental representations.},

  abstract = {Mouse tracking promises to be an efficient method to investigate the dynamics of cognitive processes: It is easier to deploy than eyetracking, yet in principle it is much more fine-grained than looking at response times. We investigated these claimed benefits directly, asking how the features of decision processes\textemdash notably, decision changes\textemdash might be captured in mouse movements. We ran two experiments, one in which we explicitly manipulated whether our stimuli triggered a flip in decision, and one in which we replicated more ecological, classical mouse-tracking results on linguistic negation (Dale \& Duran, Cognitive Science, 35, 983\textendash 996, 2011). We concluded, first, that spatial information (mouse path) is more important than temporal information (speed and acceleration) for detecting decision changes, and we offer a comparison of the sensitivities of various typical measures used in analyses of mouse tracking (area under the trajectory curve, direction flips, etc.). We do so using an ``optimal'' analysis of our data (a linear discriminant analysis explicitly trained to classify trajectories) and see what type of data (position, speed, or acceleration) it capitalizes on. We also quantify how its results compare with those based on more standard measures.},
